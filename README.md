# BMI Calculator

This BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides a convenient and accurate solution to simplify BMI calculations.  
By automating the process, it eliminates the complexities of manual computation, offering a user-friendly experience.  
BMI serves as a straightforward tool to assess whether an individual's weight aligns with a healthy range based on their height.

### BMI Formula:
$$ BMI = {weight(kg) \over height(m)^2} $$

- **Unit Conversion Support:**  
  Users can input values in either metric or imperial units, and the application handles the necessary conversions automatically.

  - **Metric units:** kilograms (kg) for weight and centimeters (cm) for height.
  - **Imperial units:** pounds (lb) for weight and feet/inches (ft/in) for height.

- **BMI Categorization:**  
  The application classifies the result into categories like underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese, providing clear insights into the user’s health status.

- **Error Handling:**  
  In case of invalid data entry (such as missing height or weight), the system provides clear error messages to guide the user.

- **Exporting Result:**  
  Users can choose to export the calculated BMI results to a text file in ASCII format for recordkeeping or future reference.
